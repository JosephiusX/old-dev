# setting up conda environment
    https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html
        probally the most simple resource that explains how to use conda

            * it seems I was getting hung up on the activation part. where as (base) means custom hadent been activated

            > in miniconda3 navigate to the project folder we we want the environment for and coonda activate with the desiered env name
                now instead of base I will see the name of the environment before the name of the project folder

            ? this does not reflict in vscode though
            > lookup setting up getbash with conda
